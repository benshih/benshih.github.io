	<p>Hi, welcome to my page. I'm currently a Mechanical Engineering PhD student at UC San Diego, in the <a target="_blank" href="http://bioinspired.eng.ucsd.edu/">Bioinspired Robotics and Design Lab</a>. I'm interested in the intersection of robotics and biology, as well as data, neuroscience, virtual reality, food automation, entrepreneurship, psychology + magic, and education. My favorite "robots" are Vision, General Grievous, Doctor Octopus, and Iron Man.</p>
