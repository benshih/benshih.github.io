		Carnegie Mellon Spring Carnival Booth - Hunting Game
	</h1>

The 2011 Spring Carnival overall theme was "when I was your age", so the members of TSA decided to revive our adventurous childhoods by building a booth representing the Oregon Trail game. 
<br><br>
The entire booth was built across approximately 4 months, with an additional 2 months of planning. Artwork inside contained a saloon, 9-foot paper mache horse, wagon, various animals, and plants. The interior of the booth varied from rock walls to safari to desert. Organization and construction of the booth was managed by Justin Wang, Jocelyn Kong, Lilian Kong, Jackson Chu, and myself; much support was given by Daniel Lin, Frank Wu, and countless others. 
<br><br>
I led the game project, a part of each booth that is judged on creativity, complexity, and implementation. My team and I worked together to lay the wires and construct the hardware placed in the booth, as well as writing the software to run the game from a computer. 
<br><br>
As a reward for our hard work, the booth took <b>first place</b> in the Individual Organizations' category!
