		Mobile Robot Communication
	</h1>

The goal for my summer project was for two robots to work together and communicate with each other to map a room, and find a “finish” point. I was also interested in improving the communication algorithm. However, due to partially available equipment and limited time in the summer, I was only able to accomplish part of this interesting summer project. I have been trying to work with two MobileRobot AmigoBots in the University of Maryland (UMD) Hybrid Network Laboratory.  I encountered many problems, including the wireless connection, incompatible camera, and the C++ compiler. After fiddling around with the parts and trying to fix the problems, I concluded that I would not be able to operate both robots simultaneously. My focus was shifted to making one robot operate autonomously. I was able to collect all the functioning pieces from both robots and put them on a single robot to make one robot function. I also developed programs which allow the robot to perform some basic movements, including turning and wandering.  In the end, I identified a list of parts that are needed for future research and documented a manual for operating the robot.

This research was undertaken as part of an internship at the <a href="http://www.isr.umd.edu/" target="_blank">University of Maryland Institute for Systems Research</a> in summer 2007.
