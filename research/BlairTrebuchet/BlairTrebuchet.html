		Trebuchet Design and Analysis
	</h1>

In this project, we explore the differences between reality and models. We construct a trebuchet using woodshop techniques in order to test if our initial launch height and velocity calculations will result in accurate landing position predictions. Using newfound statistics knowledge, we examine how accurate our trebuchet is compared to our peers. This project was a valuable opportunity to study the physics behind trebuchets and to strength woodshop experience.
