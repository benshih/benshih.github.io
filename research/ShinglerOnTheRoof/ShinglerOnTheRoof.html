	<h1>Shingler On The Roof</h1>

Shingler on the Roof targets and aims to improve the construction industry specifically by reducing the casualty rates amongst roof top construction workers. In 2012, the UK estimated that two thirds of fatal injuries in the construction industry were accounted for by falls, being struck by moving vehicles or objects, and being trapped under collapsed buildings. While the loss of life is horrific, the economic impact due to falls in the construction industry are also quite unbelievable. Nearly 400K working days were lost in the construction industry to injuries or fatalities related to falls.<br><br>

Our aim is the reduce the loss of life and the economic impact by fall related injuries and fatalities. We plan to do so by automating the process of shingling a roof, one of the leading causes of falls in the construction industry. By constructing a robot which will shingle a small roof without human intervention, our group aims to produce data that will lead to the automation of many tasks in the construction industry. This will in the long run, reduce the loss of life and lessen the economic impact to the construction industry.<br><br>

This project was done as part of Carnegie Mellon's 18-578 Mechatronic Design capstone course in Spring 2013.
